# Identifying-Dog-Breeds-with-a-CNN

A friend recently told me about how easy it is to use fast.ai for categorizing pictures so I wanted to try it out for myself. I retrained the ResNet-50 neural network in order to identify a dog picture as either a dalmatian, a dachshund, or a bergamasco shepard. Using only 111 images per breed (between both the training and validation sets) I was able to get 100% accuracy when predicting breed on the validation data.
